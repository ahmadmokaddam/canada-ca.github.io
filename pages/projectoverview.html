<h1>Improving content on Canada.ca</h1>

	<p>Small changes make a big difference.</p>

	<p>
Sometimes the words we use, and how we organize them, can make it hard for people to find and understand Government of Canada information and services on Canada.ca. The <abbr title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</abbr> Digital Transformation Office is working on projects with federal departments to make it easier.</p>

<p>For each project, we co-create prototypes, set concrete usability targets, and run usability tests with Canadians. We ask questions Canadians have about specific Government of Canada services. For a prototype to launch, it must make it at least 20% easier for people to get the right answer.</p>

<p>Considering the high numbers of visits to in-demand pages, such an increase in task success rates is significant. Ultimately it means people spend less time looking for the answers they need from the Government of Canada.</p>
