COVID-19 forced the government to operate much faster than usual. New benefits were designed and developed in record time, to support people during the pandemic. 

Across government, it was clear that we need to work together so that everyone who needs these new programs can find, understand, and use them. That includes people with physical or cognitive disabilities. 

## Usability testing with assistive technology users

To support this work, the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) conducted dozens of usability tests. Usability testing can help find problems that might affect many people. They are a key part of our toolkit in improving digital services. 

One of the studies the DTO ran assessed the accessibility of some new Canada.ca designs that are being used for certain key COVID-19 pages and programs. The study focused on people who use screen readers or magnifiers to navigate the web.  We wanted to make sure people could use these technologies to get to and understand specific content. In this study, we focused on the following pages, as they used the design patterns we wanted to test:

* [Canada.ca home page](https://www.canada.ca/en.html)
* [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&utm_medium=vanity-url&utm_source=canada-ca_coronavirus) 
* [Canada Emergency Response Benefit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) 
* [Canada Emergency Student Benefit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) 
* [Canada’s Economic Response Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html)

Just like testing on both mobile devices and desktop, it’s important to know how people using assistive technology use a website. Screen readers convert a web page to spoken text or braille. A screen magnifier lets you zoom in close to text to make it easier to read. Both technologies require different ways of navigating websites from what many content designers and authors are familiar with.

  <summary>Transcript: Navigation strategies of assistive technology users</summary>
 
<p><strong> Title: </strong> Some assistive technology navigation strategies on Canada.ca - May 2020 </p>

<p><strong> Sub-title:</strong> Participant ARCA-03 - JAWS user - Financial support from the Canada.ca homepage </p>

<p>(A screen capture of the Canada.ca homepage. We zoom in to see a window open above the page with the title "Links List". A list of links appears in the window, each link being highlighted as the participant says out loud what they are.)</p>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Participant 1:</b> Now I can't use "Skip to main content", I don't really quite know what's there first so we'll have to have a look and see.</p>
<p>(<strong>Caption:</strong> Navigating by exploring the list of links on the page)</p>
<p>Okay let's see, I see "Public pensions", "Get a passport"... Ah! Okay</p>
<p>("Coronavirus (COVID-19)" is highlighted)</p>
<p>Coronavirus - now there might be something there. You're talking about someone who's been laid off, so there might be something there. We'll come back to that in a minute.</p>
<p>("Get the support you need" is highlighted.)</p>
<p>So I'm going to start with "Get the support you need" and see if it has anything that looks like at least a good place to start. So I'll go there.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> OK</p>
<p>(Zooms out to show the page change to the Economic Response Plan.)</p>
<p><strong>Sub-title:</strong> Participant ARCA-02 - JAWS user - Financial support from the Economic Response Plan</p>
<p>(Screen shot of a page entitled, "Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan". A box moves down the page, highlighting different elements while a robotic voice (the screen reader) reads what's there.)</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader:</strong> Get the support you need. Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan dash Canada.ca. Language selection, heading level -(The box highlights the page title, then continues down the page).</p>
<p>Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan - Heading level 1. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant, decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the global COVID-19 outbreak. </p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Navigating by page element </p>
<p>Heading level 2 - On this page List with 3 items Bullet, same page link - Support for individuals. Bullet, same page link - Support for businesses. Bullet, same page link - Support for sectors. List end. Participant 2: I'm going to go to individuals, Support for individuals.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be going too fast, I'm an actual slow JAWS reader, compared to some.</p>
<p>(The selection box moves back up to the "Support for individuals" heading to the "Support for individuals" link)</p>
<p>Screen reader: Heading level 2 - Support for individuals. Heading level 3 - Individuals and families. List with 5 items. Temporary wage top-up for low-income essential workers </p>
<p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> Low-income essential… he's not an essential worker is he? Didn't say in the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader:</strong> (Unintelligible).</p>
<p>(Selection moves down the other items in the list - Increasing the Canada Child Benefit, Special Goods and Services Tax credit payment, Extra time to file income tax returns, Mortgage payment deferral, then moves to a heading "People facing loss of income").</p>
<p>Heading level 3 - People facing loss of income <strong>Participant 2:</strong> Ah!</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader:</strong> List with 1 item. Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) - button collapsed. Heading level 3 - Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>(Selection moves from the "Indigenous peoples" ).</p>
<p>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) - button expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> It's a collapsed link so it actually expanded which is good - it worked. Because they don't always work.</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader:</strong> We will provide a taxable benefit of $2000 every 4 weeks...</p>
<p>Sub-title: Participant ARCA-05 - Windows Magnifier user - When to re-apply for CERB.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 3:</strong> OK I just go to re-apply and see what the instructions say if I go from there.</p>
<p>It's right underneath there anyway "If your situation continues you should apply for the...</p>
<p>(Pointer moves around the screen, looking for more detail).</p>
<p>So I'm not sure because it's not saying right here where I'd expect it to be when I should apply for May 10th. It's just saying that I should re-apply every 4 weeks. Unless I missed it I don't see it here.</p>
<p>Caption: Uses the side menu to orient himself.</p>
<p>(Pointer moves to the Section menu at the right of the screen).</p>
<p>Yeah: "Who can apply," "How to apply…" Shows me that I'm actually on, "Keep getting my payments." So I feel like I'm in the right spot. Oh! There it is!</p>
<p>(Pointer moves to below the "Determine when to apply" link).</p>
<p><strong>Sub-title:</strong> Participant ARCA-04 - NVDA user - Contact about CERB.</p>
<p>(Screen capture of a page entitled "Applying for CERB with CRA: How to Apply". The page has a menu on the right labeled "Sections". A selection box moves around the elements on the page. Screen reader is audible throughout the video, but is unintelligible)</p>
<p><strong>Participant 4:</strong> Contact us about CERB - Hey! Let's try that!</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader:</strong> (Unintelligible)</p>
 <p><strong>Participant 4:</strong> You've got to contact the department you applied with, that's good.</p>
<p>1-800-959-8281. Oh, that's the normal CRA number.</p>

Overall, the testing showed that the new templates and patterns performed well for assistive technologies. Participants commented on how the clear link text, subway navigation pattern, larger fonts and simple design helped them understand the content.

We did find some areas that need improvement. For example:
* some pages had repeated duplicate links, which can be confusing if you navigate by listening to a list of links on the page
* one page had a button that didn’t appear to have any effect when clicked, because there was no cue that the page had changed 
* verbal descriptions on how to use menu controls were too wordy

Some of the things we heard:



We’re now working to make the necessary changes to further increase the effectiveness of these designs. Moving forward, we will continue to do more testing with people who have different types of disabilities. 

## Well designed content helps everyone

Regardless of the audience we test with, the evidence comes back each time showing how basic design techniques make content work better for everyone. Our research with screen readers showed once again the importance of clear headings, links, and language in navigating Canada.ca.
