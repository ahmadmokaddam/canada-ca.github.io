This is the first post of a series explaining how public servants are coming together to modernize the tools we need to build a more effective web presence for the Government of Canada. In this edition we look at what a design system is and why we’re making one.

In September 2019, the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) and collaborators from across the Government of Canada came together to discuss building a Government of Canada Design System.

We had people from the Aurora and Clone (Talent Cloud) design systems, the Canadian Digital Service (CDS), Digital Academy, and the Web Experience Toolkit. We also had design specialists from across departments, including ISED, CRA, IRCC, and DND.

## Introducing the Government of Canada Design System

Since September, we’ve been working to turn the vision of a Government of Canada Design System into reality. An overarching design system will make it easier for departments to build a modern digital presence that helps people get the information and services they need. At the same time, it will help maintain a trusted digital brand.

We are pulling together elements from:
* the Web Experience Toolkit and its GCWeb implementation
* the Canada.ca Style Guide
* the Canada.ca pattern library

This means that there will be one place to go to get the right tools and guidance.

But what exactly is a design system?

## Design system defined

There are many definitions of a design system out there. Here’s our take on it:

A design system is a collection of flexible and reusable design and code elements, supported by research and clear guidelines. It gives teams the building blocks they need to design their online presence in a way that supports task success and trust for their users.

Design systems usually include:

* a library of reusable design elements, along with the code to create them
* best practices and guidance, based on evidence, for how to use those design elements
* design principles
* a writing style guide
* guidance on branding

In other words, a design system should help you build the right thing, and it should help you build it the right way.

There are a lot of amazing examples to start from. Large Canadian companies like Shopify as well as other governments like the UK and Australia, have launched successful design systems. These systems help create an easy-to-use, coherent digital experience for people.

## Why we need a Government of Canada design system

When people can easily predict how to navigate your online presence, readily understand how to interact with your content and confidently identify the source of that content, they are more successful completing tasks online.

A design system supports this predictability and brand recognition. The result? Millions of Canadians can more successfully complete online interactions with the government every day.

Here are 3 ways a design system will help everyone working on Government of Canada web content:

### Building trust through a consistent experience

When using online services, people want to know who they’re dealing with. The Government of Canada, through the Federal Identity Program, has a very strong brand. It’s recognized the world over.  Our web presence needs to take advantage of that strong brand to foster trust.

But a strong brand in the digital world is about more than logos and symbols. It needs to include an overall experience that’s consistent and integrated. That’s why the design system includes global styles for typography, colours and layouts, as well as a common header and footer.

### Helping build better, usable services faster

Why try to solve an issue that somebody else has already solved?

The design system will include a rich library of design and layout options. It will offer advice on best practices, instead of emphasizing “one-size-fits-all” templates and rules.

This will help you fast-track design decisions, building with elements that have already been proven to be effective. While this doesn’t eliminate the need to test what you build with your users, it means you’re starting from a solid foundation. You can get to the business of perfecting the user experience sooner.

You don’t need to spend time working out basic issues of visual style or accessibility compliance. Your valuable time can go to creating high quality content that helps people complete their tasks.

### Enabling continuous improvement through experimentation

While previous lessons learned and tested patterns are a great starting point, they should in no way be considered perfect and “final”. They need to evolve based on new evidence.

The design system will be community driven - drawing on the collective creativity and innovative ideas of colleagues across departments. Have an idea for a better way to display information in a table or create an interactive wizard? Our alpha environment will allow for prototyping and testing as well as community feedback and collaboration. Patterns that turn out to be effective at solving design issues will be added to the design system library for others to use.

This model will allow for faster, iterative updates, and will support ongoing improvement to service design.

## Bringing the vision to reality

The Design System Working Group meets every 2 weeks. We are making concrete progress toward bringing the Government of Canada Design System vision to reality.

### Build it with us!

This open-source, community-based project will be as strong as the community behind it.
