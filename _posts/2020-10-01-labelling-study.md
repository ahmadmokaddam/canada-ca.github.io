Canada.ca/Coronavirus is one of the most visited pages on Canada.ca. Teams across government have been collaborating and updating this page regularly to reflect the evolving needs of the Canadian public. In last week’s blog post, we talked about how we organized Canada.ca/coronavirus based on top tasks. 

[Improving Canada.ca by focusing on top tasks](https://blog.canada.ca/2020/09/24/COVID-top-tasks.html)

This week, we’re looking at the labels we’ve chosen for categories and links on that page, and how they improve the ‘findability’ of the top tasks. The public depends on us to choose the right words for the category and link labels to ensure that they can find answers quickly and easily on Canada.ca. That has become even more evident during this pandemic. 

In the online top task study we did with the World Health Organization and Gerry McGovern in May, over 6,000 Canadians ranked their top COVID-related tasks. The results mostly matched the top task links already on the Canada.ca/Coronavirus page. We also identified some new “recovery” tasks. 

To get people to content for these emerging top tasks, we had to create some new categories and links. The labels for these had to accurately reflect how people thought about the new tasks.  Since we used evidence to identify the new tasks, we used evidence to find the best labels.
