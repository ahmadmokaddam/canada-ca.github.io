Canada.ca/Coronavirus is one of the most visited pages on Canada.ca. Teams across government have been collaborating and updating this page regularly to reflect the evolving needs of the Canadian public. In last week’s blog post, we talked about how we organized Canada.ca/coronavirus based on top tasks. 

[Improving Canada.ca by focusing on top tasks](https://blog.canada.ca/2020/09/24/COVID-top-tasks.html)

This week, we’re looking at the labels we’ve chosen for categories and links on that page, and how they improve the ‘findability’ of the top tasks. The public depends on us to choose the right words for the category and link labels to ensure that they can find answers quickly and easily on Canada.ca. That has become even more evident during this pandemic. 

In the online top task study we did with the World Health Organization and Gerry McGovern in May, over 6,000 Canadians ranked their top COVID-related tasks. The results mostly matched the top task links already on the Canada.ca/Coronavirus page. We also identified some new “recovery” tasks. 

To get people to content for these emerging top tasks, we had to create some new categories and links. The labels for these had to accurately reflect how people thought about the new tasks.  Since we used evidence to identify the new tasks, we used evidence to find the best labels. 

## The labelling study

In June 2020, DTO and Health Canada launched a follow-up labelling study in both English and French. On Canada.ca, we randomly invited people to participate in the study from June 8 to 10, 2020.  

### Stats
* 3,053 people participated 
* 85% did the study in English 
* 15% did the study in French
* More than half completed the entire study of 10 task questions (58%)

Participants responded to the task questions by clicking on one of the potential label options shown with the question. The survey asked them to choose as if they were attempting the task on the website.  Each question showed different sets of label options for both the links and the categories. This let us explore how different options fit with specific task scenarios.

## Taking action on results
Together with Health Canada we used the results to support updates on the COVID-19 landing page. The study confirmed that some labels were working well, so we kept those in place. 

Then we looked at what new content was ready and the approvals needed for some of the proposed changes. Based on this, we added a couple of new labels right away to reflect the results of the study.
