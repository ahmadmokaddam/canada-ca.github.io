In 2019, the Digital Transformation Office worked with our colleagues in the Results Division of Treasury Board Secretariat to put in place a new key performance indicator. It evaluates citizens’ ability to complete high-demand tasks on the Government of Canada’s web presence. 37 departments had to report on the new indicator in 2019.

Measuring online task completion helps us understand how design improvements affect task success. It also helps institutions adopt a top task approach to managing online information and services.

As we analyzed the results early in 2020, we learned a lot about the different methods for measuring online task success.

## Background

The official name of the new indicator is “Communications Services - Outcome 2 (CS-O2).” It is part of the internal services indicators under the [Policy on Results](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31300).  

Reporting on this indicator pushes Government of Canada institutions to make service delivery a priority. It helps them plan their digital work around improving success for top tasks online. This aligns with the [Government of Canada’s Digital Standard](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) on empowering staff to deliver better services.

</blockquote>

In the spirit of experimentation and respect for available resources, the Digital Transformation Office offered 3 methods to complete this report:

* usability testing
* task funnel analysis
* task completion survey

## How tasks were measured across the reporting institutions

We compiled the data that each institution sent. We tagged each task with the collection method, number of participants, time period, and success rate.  Here’s what we found.

<b>Reporting method</b>
* 9 Surveys
* 8 Usability tests
* 7 Task funnels
* 2 Other methods

<b>Types of tasks reported </b>
* 283 reported tasks
* Over 200 tasks about looking for answers to questions
* 23 tasks about applying, renewing, filing, or registering
* 15 contact us tasks
* 15 jobs and careers seeking tasks
* 18 tasks about downloading, signing in, purchasing, or calculating

<b>Task success</b>
We looked at the success rate for all tasks that were tested with over 20 participants. 101 tasks met this criteria.
* The average success rate for these 101 tasks was 64%
* 32 tasks had a high success rating of over 80%

9 institutions had high success tasks. These were mostly answer-finding tasks. Topics included border wait times, career opportunities, and travel health notices.

Lower performing tasks often included applying or registering for things. It’s difficult to pinpoint the cause of the lower success rates. Possible causes include:
