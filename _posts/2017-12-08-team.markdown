---
The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is part of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Strategic Communications and Ministerial Affairs sector. At DTO, we are communications professionals with expertise in content and interaction design, user research and plain language writing.

We work with departments to:

* ensure that the Canada.ca brand is recognized and trusted by Canadians

* make information and services that are in demand and published on digital channels easier to find and understand based on insight from user research

* help communications teams develop their skills and processes as they make a sustainable shift to digital in their organization

<p>After finishing her Masters of Digital Media, Eleanor made it her mission to help Canadians access information online. Her role at the DTO involves creating engaging web content that is both useful and accurate. Coding and UX design are among the skills Eleanor would like to develop during her time here. 
</p><p>Before joining the Canada.ca team, Eleanor interned at a creative agency in Toronto. She has also worked for small and medium sized businesses where she first got a taste for digital marketing and strategy. In 2016, Eleanor earned a Bachelor’s degree in English, Psychology and Women’s Studies. This odd but nevertheless interesting combination of disciplines continues to serve her well.</p>
