description: "Here’s how we’ve approached design research as part of the COVID-19 digital response. "
---

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) usually runs “short” 3-month optimization projects. When the pandemic was confirmed in mid-March, we pivoted to conducting rapid-response design research on COVID-19 content and aspects of the Canada.ca information architecture. Our priority remains delivering clear and usable digital-first content on Canada.ca, the crisis situation just meant we had to do it faster.

Here’s how we’ve approached design research as part of the COVID-19 digital response.


## 1. Prioritizing research that will deliver the biggest impact

With DTO’s experience managing the Canada.ca information architecture, we quickly realized that every corner of the Canada.ca landscape would be affected. Our research is focussed on improving both the content and information architecture related to the pandemic.

We prioritized our work on areas that would deliver the biggest improvement to digital service delivery. In the very early days, this meant testing a revised information architecture for COVID-19 topics and improving existing content to reduce the demand on call centres.

In the following weeks, we collaborated with other departments on larger research studies that have helped shape some of the biggest economic relief programs we’ve seen in our lifetime.

## 2. Adapting our timelines into days not weeks

Light and fast research helped inform daily recommendations. Where possible, we combined [previous research from DTO optimization projects] (https://blog.canada.ca/pages/project-overview.html) with new research to deliver evidence-based recommendations to web teams and senior management.

We used easy to access data like web analytics, social media monitoring and call centre questions to identify areas where we could focus our research - often working these problems directly into task scenarios.


## 3. Unmoderated testing: Rapid recommendations in 48 hours

The team’s existing access to unmoderated testing tools allowed us to rapidly test and deliver recommendations within 48 hours. Unmoderated tests were conducted every 2 to 3 days with 6 to 8 Canadians per test. This allowed us to identify big issues and analyze the video recordings in a few hours.

We developed a rhythm for our activities and packaged these prototypes as ready-to-use solutions to make implementation as smooth as possible.

<section>
<div class="well well-sm">
<h3>48-hour testing schedule</h3>
<strong>Day one</strong>
<ol>
<li>Identify priorities in the morning</li>
<li>Prototype during the day</li>
<li>Develop scenarios and build the test in the afternoon</li>
<li>Run test overnight
</li>
</ol>

<strong>Day two</strong>
<ol>
<li>Analyze videos and compile recommendations in the morning
</li>
<li>Deliver or communicate results in the afternoon.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat and retest!</p>

</div>
</section>


Unmoderated testing allowed us to get some rest while the tests ran overnight. It was the fastest method to test prototypes or live content and was flexible enough to recruit some specialized audiences. Spend a little time to try your task scenarios out on friends or family first, you may find that people interpret the task in unexpected ways. Even when a task is interpreted differently, you can still learn a lot about the participant’s mental model.

As the situation stabilized, research activities became larger and aligned to upcoming announcements. Larger projects, like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) underwent many rounds of testing and iterations.

            </dl>
        </section>


## 4. Used moderated testing strategically

We reserved moderated testing for when we needed specialized audiences like business owners, students, or [people using assistive technologies] (https://blog.canada.ca/2020/06/05/designing-for-accessibility.html). Using a moderator gave us time to schedule the testing over several days while we worked on complex prototypes. This provided more flexibility to ask follow-up questions when we saw interesting behaviours and probe for more details allowing us to get the most out of the sessions.

The moderator can encourage participants to continue on a task where they may have otherwise given up in an unmoderated test.

## 5. Working together while being physically apart

We tweaked our existing ways of working with colleagues across government. Video calls replaced on-site meetings and we sent more Slack messages than ever before. Otherwise, many processes remained unchanged. We continued to work collaboratively using shared documents, and prototyped in the open.

Working closely (but distantly!) with departmental communications and web teams helped us align the right research, with the right questions at the right time.

### Key lessons learned

* Test early, test often
* Focus your efforts where you can make the biggest impact
* Connect early and often with your call centres
* Include videos and quotations to support your recommendations
* Make your recommendations as easy to implement as possible
* Keep a record of your work (screenshots and summaries)
* Clear language is the best investment for your website

### Challenges when doing rapid research

Even though we learned a lot, the journey wasn’t without challenges. One of the hardest transitions for the team in the first few weeks of pandemic design research was speed and volume of new content being produced. Testing and iterating on live content was the new normal.

## Final word

In a crisis, like COVID-19, poor content or a poor user experience undermines the credibility of the government. You can identify many of the usability problems with a page by testing it with even just a few users. Identifying and correcting usability problems early helped divert unnecessary calls from call centres and reduced ineligible or incomplete applications for benefits.

We encourage you to implement advice from web content design specialists about already-established best practices in user experience. Rely on standard templates and content design recommendations from the [Canada.ca design system] (https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system.html). These are based on best practices that have been tested with users to ensure they work and are accessible.
